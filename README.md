# Hey, I’m Brian Palmer 👋

Founder, engineer, and systems builder.  
I design and ship software that has to work in the real world, under load, with money, users, and regulators involved.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build production SaaS products from zero to live users
- Architect scalable backends and data systems
- Ship AI-powered features that solve concrete problems
- Navigate payments, compliance, and real-world constraints
- Prefer shipping over theorizing

I have 10+ years of experience across cloud platforms, data systems, and product engineering. Recently focused on AI infrastructure, fintech, and marketplace-style systems.

Based in Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦
